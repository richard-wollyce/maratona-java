## Maratona Java - DevDojo

This repository contains all `.java` files related to my study of Java through Maratona Java by DevDojo.

My intention is to build a strong project around this programming language, and by sharing it, I hope it helps someone in the future.

The goal here is also to showcase my thought process around the technology, how I approach issues, and my personal evolution as a developer as I sharpen my problem-solving skills.

Cheers,
Richard Wollyce.
